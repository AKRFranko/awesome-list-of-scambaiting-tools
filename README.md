Awesome List of Scambaiting Tools

# Useful websites

- [credicardvalidator.org](https://www.creditcardvalidator.org/generator)  You can use this tool to generate random credit card numbers that use valid IINs based on the card scheme chosen, and pass Luhn algorithm verification. You can also generate CVCs and expiration dates if needed. These card numbers are useful for testing payment verification systems, etc.
- [Mynoise.net](https://mynoise.net/) myNoise creates beautiful noises to mask the noises you donâ€™t want to hear : your chatty colleagues, tinnitus, or even your inner voice when you can't shut it down! The concept is simple, works extremely well, and does not require expensive noise-cancelling headphones. (note: infinite soundscapes like cars and factories also included!)

# Setup

- [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. (note: for all you noobs paying for VMware, this is free and powerful)
